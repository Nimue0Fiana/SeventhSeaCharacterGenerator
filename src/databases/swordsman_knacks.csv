1,1,Bind (Buckler),"A Bind is only usable against an opponent’s fencing weapon. It locks your sword (or buckler, or panzerhand) and his sword together. To use this attack, you declare that you are attempting to Bind your opponent’s weapon, and then roll to attack using this Knack. If successful, you have momentarily bound his sword. While the two of you are in the Bind, neither of you can use your bound item."
2,1,Disarm (Fencing),"You can only use this Knack after an opponent has just missed your Passive Defense. Spend an Action Die to make a Contested Roll of your Brawn + Disarm versus his Brawn + Attack (in the weapon he is wielding). If you win, the weapon is knocked out of his hand. If you perform this move with two Raises, you can wind up holding the weapon if you choose."
3,1,Riposte (Fencing),"A riposte is a parry followed up immediately with a counterattack. You first attempt an Active Defense against the incoming Attack, and then, if the Active Defense is successful, make an Attack of your own on the person who just attacked you. When performing a Riposte, you receive one-half the dice from your Parry Knack (rounded down) for your Active Defense and one-half the dice from your Attack Knack (rounded down) for your counterattack. For every Rank in Riposte, you may add one die to either the Active Defense attempt or the counterattack. These dice are added after you’ve halved the appropriate Knacks."
4,1,Exploit Weakness (Donovan),"Once you have attended a School, you have not only learned its strengths, but its weaknesses as well. Whenever you duel against someone who is using a School whose weakness you are familiar with, even if you aren’t currently using that style of fighting yourself, you gain a number of unkept dice (+1k0 each) equal to your Rank in your Exploit Weakness Knack to all your Attack and Active Defense rolls. A Swordsman who attends more than one School obviously knows more than one weakness..."
5,2,Feint (Fencing),"When attacking the enemy, you can declare a Feint. You roll Finesse + Feint, but you must make a number of Raises equal to your enemy’s Wits. If you manage this, he cannot avoid the attack using any Active Defense."
6,2,Riposte (Fencing),"A riposte is a parry followed up immediately with a counterattack. You first attempt an Active Defense against the incoming Attack, and then, if the Active Defense is successful, make an Attack of your own on the person who just attacked you. When performing a Riposte, you receive one-half the dice from your Parry Knack (rounded down) for your Active Defense and one-half the dice from your Attack Knack (rounded down) for your counterattack. For every Rank in Riposte, you may add one die to either the Active Defense attempt or the counterattack. These dice are added after you’ve halved the appropriate Knacks."
7,2,Tagging (Fencing),"Tagging is a particularly flashy piece of showing off with your weapon, designed to temporarily dishearten your enemy. This could be anything from cutting off a lock of his hair to carving your initials in his shirt. You must use this Knack instead of your Attack Knack for your Attack Roll. If you successfully hit, the attack causes no damage, but you can cause one of two things to happen. Either your opponent loses 1 Drama Die until the end of the battle (at which point it returns), or you can gain 1 Drama Die yourself until the end of the battle (at which point it disappears if still unspent). These Drama Dice never become Experience Points, even if the battle was the last thing to happen in the Story."
8,2,Exploit Weakness (Aldana),"Once you have attended a School, you have not only learned its strengths, but its weaknesses as well. Whenever you duel against someone who is using a School whose weakness you are familiar with, even if you aren’t currently using that style of fighting yourself, you gain a number of unkept dice (+1k0 each) equal to your Rank in your Exploit Weakness Knack to all your Attack and Active Defense rolls. A Swordsman who attends more than one School obviously knows more than one weakness..."
9,3,Double-parry (Fencing/Knife),"A double-parry is parrying with two blades (usually a fencing weapon and a main gauche) crossed before you. You may declare that you are using this Knack instead of an ordinary Parry as an Active Defense. Success grants one Drama Die, which can be used for a number of Phases equal to your Rank with this maneuver. In any event, if you do not use the Drama Die by the end of the Round, you lose it."
10,3,Feint (Fencing),"When attacking the enemy, you can declare a Feint. You roll Finesse + Feint, but you must make a number of Raises equal to your enemy’s Wits. If you manage this, he cannot avoid the attack using any Active Defense."

14,4,Pommel Strike (Fencing),"A pommel strike involves smashing the hilt of your sword into your target’s face. You declare that you are using this Knack instead of the Attack Knack. If your attack gets through, you inflict a 0k2 attack, and your opponent’s TN to be hit is reduced to 5 until the end of the next Phase."
15,4,Riposte (Fencing),"A riposte is a parry followed up immediately with a counterattack. You first attempt an Active Defense against the incoming Attack, and then, if the Active Defense is successful, make an Attack of your own on the person who just attacked you.
