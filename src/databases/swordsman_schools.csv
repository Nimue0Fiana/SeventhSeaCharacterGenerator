1,1,Donovan,"This style is somewhat old-fashioned, using a bucker and smallsword instead of the more modern rapier and main gauche. This style teaches a wide variety of slashes and thrusts, which tends to confuse those trained to fight against thrusts almost exclusively."
2,2,Aldana,"Aldana is designed for use with fencing weapons. The fencer's hand is tucked behind their back. Aldana combines sword fighting with dancing to produce an elusive, unpredictable series of movements. The duelist silently counts time inside his head, mentally playing the song that he is 'dancing' to. This allows him to make unpredictable moves along with the rhythm of the song, which is unknown to his opponent."
3,3,Valroux,"The Valroux style is one of several that uses a fencing weapon in the primary hand and a main gauche in the off-hand. The fighting style is technically defensive, with the main gauche used only to parry. Students of this style are prone to teasing their opponents. They call attention to openings they could have exploited, generally humiliate their opponents and then finish them off whenever the duel grows wearisome."
4,4,Ambrogia,"Ambrogia teaches its students to fight with their sword in their left hand, and their main gauche in their right. While Ambrogia does focus on the left hand, it emphasizes practicality over style. "
