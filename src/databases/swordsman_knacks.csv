1,6,1,Bind (Buckler),"A Bind is only usable against an opponent’s fencing weapon. It locks your sword (or buckler, or panzerhand) and his sword together. To use this attack, you declare that you are attempting to Bind your opponent’s weapon, and then roll to attack using this Knack. If successful, you have momentarily bound his sword. While the two of you are in the Bind, neither of you can use your bound item."
2,5,1,Disarm (Fencing),"You can only use this Knack after an opponent has just missed your Passive Defense. Spend an Action Die to make a Contested Roll of your Brawn + Disarm versus his Brawn + Attack (in the weapon he is wielding). If you win, the weapon is knocked out of his hand. If you perform this move with two Raises, you can wind up holding the weapon if you choose."
3,5,1,Riposte (Fencing),"A riposte is a parry followed up immediately with a counterattack. You first attempt an Active Defense against the incoming Attack, and then, if the Active Defense is successful, make an Attack of your own on the person who just attacked you. When performing a Riposte, you receive one-half the dice from your Parry Knack (rounded down) for your Active Defense and one-half the dice from your Attack Knack (rounded down) for your counterattack. For every Rank in Riposte, you may add one die to either the Active Defense attempt or the counterattack. These dice are added after you’ve halved the appropriate Knacks."
4,,1,Exploit Weakness (Donovan),"Once you have attended a School, you have not only learned its strengths, but its weaknesses as well.

A Swordsman who attends more than one School obviously knows more than one weakness..."

21,3,2,Etiquette (Courtier),"While it might be acceptable to throw the bones of your meal upon the floor in some regions, it is certain that other nobility would faint upon seeing some ruffian throw a greasy bone on their new rug.

If you successfully hit, the attack causes no damage, but you can cause one of two things to happen. Either your opponent loses 1 Drama Die until the end of the battle (at which point it returns), or you can gain 1 Drama Die yourself until the end of the battle (at which point it disappears if still unspent).
